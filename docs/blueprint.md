## Core Features:

- File Upload: Accepts image files (png, jpg, gif, webp) via drag and drop or file selection.
- Image Display: Displays the selected image along with file details (name, size, type, dimensions).
- AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages a generative AI tool to describe notable characteristics (e.g., color profile, layout, feature, etc.) with the image. The AI model intelligently assesses the characteristics actually 'notable'.

- Clean and modern typography to ensure readability and a professional appearance.
- Simple, clear icons to represent different file types and actions.
